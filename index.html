    <p>I was born in Orlando, Florida on October 10th 1992. I grew up in Southwest Orlando with my parents and still currently reside there. After graduating from Freedom High School in 2011 I was accepted to UCF.  In 2016 I graduated UCF with a Bachelor’s Degree in Marketing from the College of Business.
    </p>
   <p> After graduation I got my 2-15 insurance license and went to work for New York Life. I am currently out of the insurance industry and working in the service industry for Maggiano’s. Recently I have been looking for a new passion that can lead to a career path and decided to enroll in the UCF Coding Boot Camp. So far, even in this short time, I have learned so much and cannot wait to keep learning more!
   </p> 
       <p> Living in Orlando for 25 years and counting, I am no stranger to the hustle and bustle of living in a fast-paced city filled with all different types of walks of life. I cannot image ever living in a small quiet town, away from the city life. On the other hand, there is one part of Orlando I absolutely cannot stand and that is the heat! With that in mind it makes sense that I would love to start a career in either New York City or Chicago.
